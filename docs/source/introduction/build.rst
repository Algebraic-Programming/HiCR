Building & Installation
************************

The HiCR Core API is a self-sufficient include-only library that does not require compilation. Its backends, however, may require the presence of dependencies (libraries or drivers) in the system to work and link against. Its frontends may also contain source code that requires compilation. We use the `Meson <https://mesonbuild.com>`_ build system to handle all of these aspects and provide a seamless compilation of HiCR-based applications.
