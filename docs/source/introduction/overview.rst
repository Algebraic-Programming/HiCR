HiCR is model for runtime support libraries for the development of future-proof, high-performance runtime systems and applications. Its goal is to serve as the foundation layer for kernel execution, thread and task scheduling, resource management, and data motion capabilities over heterogeneous, distributed, mobile, and cloud-based systems. 

Extensive overview and implementation details can be read in our paper `pre-print <https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01425>`_
