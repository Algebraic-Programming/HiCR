This repository provides include-only C++ implementation of the HiCR model. It allows for representing the semantics of distributed heterogeneous applications by providing a minimal set of abstract operations to enable hardware topology discovery, kernel execution, memory management, communication, and instance management. 

## Paper

For a detailed explanation of the HiCR model, please see our preprint:

[HiCR, an Abstract Model for Distributed Heterogeneous Programming](https://github.com/Algebraic-Programming/Preprints/tree/master/HiCR)
